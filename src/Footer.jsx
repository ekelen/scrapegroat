      The <strong>groat</strong> is the traditional name of a defunct English
      and Irish silver coin worth four pence, and also a Scottish coin which was
      originally worth fourpence, with later issues being valued at eightpence
      and one shilling. The name has also been applied to{" "}
      <strong>any thick or large coin</strong>, such as the{" "}
      <strong>Groschen (grosso)</strong>, a silver coin issued by Tyrol in 1271
      and Venice in the 13th century, which was the first of this general size
      to circulate in the Holy Roman Empire and other parts of Europe. The
      immediate ancestor to the groat was the French{" "}
      <strong>gros tournois</strong> or <strong>groat of Tours</strong>, which
      was known as the <strong>groot</strong> (Dutch for <em>great</em> or{" "}
      <em>large</em>) in the Netherlands.
